# Contributing to this project

Thanks for being interested in contributing to this package and overall project!
This document contains guidelines for getting started with contributing.

## Overall mission

My hope from this toolkit/package is to build a R toolkit (or ecosystem of
packages) so that biomedical researchers can adhere to and use open scientific
practices in an easy and as automated way as possible so that the barrier to
being open and reproducible is as low as possible. Currently, the project is
aimed at R users, but I would like to eventually make it more language agnostic
(I know, this is still an R package).

One of the current challenges of being open is that it is hard to start doing it,
since it is still so new and in constant discussion and development. There are
also not a lot of resources for those in biomedical/health research for learning
about it. This project hopes to start fixing those issues.

## Things to know before starting

Please read over the [Contributor Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md). By participating
in this project you agree to abide by its terms. For more information on a big
picture overview of what is happening, check out the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md). For
other details, check out the [README](README.md).

## How and what to contribute

I am looking for any and all ideas and contributions. Mostly this project needs
help on the R development side, the user interface side, and for ideas on what 
needs to be included to simplify doing open science.

### Bugs, enhancements, or other comments

Have a suggestion, idea, or comment, but don't have the time or expertise to 
contribute code or documentation? No worries! Head over to the
[Issues](https://github.com/lwjohnst86/prodigenr/issues) page, create a new Issue,
and type out those thoughts and ideas!

### Code or documentation

This project adheres to the [tidyverse coding style](http://style.tidyverse.org/),
so please stick to writing code in that form if you want to contribute, fix, or
enhance R functions.

Git messages should be clear and concisely describe the change made in the commit.

This document is still in development, so bear with me :)
