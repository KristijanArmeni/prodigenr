## Mission statement

{{reiterate. Include mention of audience aka biomedical researchers}}

## External tools and services  

The number and possible tools and services to conduct open science is broad and 
diverse. This gives a lot of strength, especially since this is the time for open
science to grow and evolve. However, this is also a huge barrier for those
researchers and scientists who are just starting out. There is too much choices
and little guidance on what to use and choose. Given the possible choices
available, this is toolkit with a strong opinion on what to use. So, let's start
with the opinions! A quick overview of the larger steps involved in creating
scientific output.

- *File management* will be done using Git{{link}} and either stored on
GitHub{{link}} or on GitLab{{link}}. This keeps track of changes to the files
and code, focuses the project into a single folder structure and emphasizes a final
"product" from the coding and writing. It also makes it easier to disseminate 
and publish later on.
- *Coding and analyses* will all be done in R{{link}}. This obvious for now,
since this is an R package! However, I would like this toolkit to eventually be
more language agnostic... but baby steps.
- *Writing* will be done in R Markdown{{link}} files. This provides the ability
to insert R code chunk so that figures, tables, and results can be regenerated
easily and reproducibly. This also includes not just manuscripts, but slides and
posters (more on this below).
- *Dissemination* of the whole project will be done using Zenodo{{link}} to create
a DOI onces the manuscript has been submitted, or the poster or slides presented.
Manuscripts will be submitted to bioRxiv{{link}} while posters and slides will be
submitted to figshare{{link}}.
- *All activities* will be done in RStudio{{link}}.

### Managing files and tracking changes

All projects, files, coding, writing, and other activities will be done in
RStudio{{link}}. RStudio is an exceptional environment to use R{{link}} in
and has many features that make it easier to follow open scientific workflows.

Version control{{link}} is vital to an open scientific workflow. Since Git{{link}}
is well established in the open source, software development, and R package
development world, it is the natural choice for version control. In addition,
RStudio has an excellent and fairly easy to use interface{{link}} with Git

### The coding and analysis phase

Analyses should follow the style similar to creating R packages (read this
excellent and easy to read book{{link}} on R package creation).

- R code should as much as possible be written as functions{{link}} in the `R/`
folder.
- Use devtools, usethis, etc workflow (`load_all()`)
- Data, results output, etc will be saved in `data/`

### The writing phase:

- After sending out for general feedback from co-authors, increase version number
- General collaboration should be done through GitHub Pull Requests{{link}} or
through GitLab Merge Requests{{link}}. If technical skill of Git is low, designate
a team member as the "Git liaison".

### Dissemination

- After submitting, increase version number

Notes:
- Bibliography files... as long as it interacts with R Markdown{{link to biblio}}
- CSL{{link}} for citation styling.
- Slides created using any of the output options (preferably html, since pdf
will involve latex installation).
- Posters ... still need to figure this out...

- Strong opinion on how projects should be structured or organized and how to be open/where to send code
    - Use R package framework
    - Use travis or gitlab-ci
    - Some type of CI should be able to generate your manuscript without errors
    - Create new branch for each submission/sending to co-authors
