This is a new submission. It's not a big project and I don't plan on updating it
frequently.

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 12.04 install, R 3.2.5
* OS X (on travis-ci and on a labmates Mac), R 3.2.5
* win-builder (devel and release) as well as lab's Win 7 install

## R CMD check results

On local install and travis-ci there were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

On win-builder there was one NOTE that as far as I can tell relate to the
package being a new submission.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
